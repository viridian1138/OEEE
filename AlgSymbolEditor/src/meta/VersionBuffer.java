/**
 * VersionBuffer is a class that allows objects to support persistence in a way
 * that is relatively robust to versioning changes over a program's life cycle.
 * Although VersionBuffer can not handle something as drastic as a complete
 * schema change, it is very useful when items in a schema add or change some
 * of their properties.  VersionBuffer implements an object-oriented version of
 * a property list.  Items are read from or written to the list by assigning
 * each item to a key of type String.  One advantage of this keyed access is that
 * objects can be read in a different order from how they are written.  In many
 * complex schema the best order for writing information is not always the same
 * as the best order for reading it.  VersionBuffer insulates the application
 * from this difficulty.
 * <P>
 * Several kinds of versioning are supported by version buffer:
 * <P>
 * Case #1: a particular property changes its object type in a new version of the
 * software.  For instance, a java.awt.Point in JDK 1.1 could change to a Point2D.
 * In the new version of the software, read the tag into a variable of type Object
 * and then use the "instanceof" operator to interrogate it.  If it's a Point object
 * from the old file format, convert it.  If it's a Point2D from the new file format,
 * use it as-is.
 * <P>
 * Case #2: a piece of kluge data is not needed any more in the new version of the software.
 * Simply stop reading and writing
 * that particular tag in the new version of the software.  Older files will still work,
 * they'll simply contain a tag that you're no longer paying attention to.
 * <P>
 * Case #3: a completely new property is added to some object.  Attempt to read the
 * object using the new tag.  If the result is null, you're reading the old file format
 * and you need to insert some default for that property.  If it's non-null, you're
 * reading the new file format and you can use the object as-is.  Note that when reading
 * from an old format, the default for reading old data may not be the same as the default
 * for creating new data.  Suppose you create a program that does everything in 12 point
 * font (without saving any font data in its file format), and then somebody says "I want to be
 * able to change the font, and I want the default font on new documents to be 24 point."
 * When reading an old-format file, the default font size that you would insert into
 * your data would most likely be 12 point.  But when the user creates a new document, the
 * default for that document would be 24 point.
 * <P>
 * Due to time limitations on the author this is not a comprehensive description, but it should give
 * one some ideas about how to handle versioning with this class.
